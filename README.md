# THE SKIN CANCER CLASSIFICATION AND SEGMENTATION USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES

Skin cancer is common, and early detection is vital for better outcomes. This paper explores AI techniques for 
classifying skin lesions as benign or malignant and segmenting lesions using methods like CNNs and image processing. 
Combining classification and segmentation improves diagnostic accuracy, aiding precise treatment decisions.
